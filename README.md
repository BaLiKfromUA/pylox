# pylox

**pylox** is Python implementation of Lox programming language which is a demo language from [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) book by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent).

I'm doing this because:

1. I want to learn about programming languages design and implementation.
2. I don't want to just read the book or copy and paste the code from it and I want to do something else than C or Java.
3. I want to become more "fluent" with Python and its dev infrastructure.
4. Fun.

## Challenges

- [X] Add support to Loxâ€™s scanner for C-style /* ... */ block comments. Make sure to handle newlines in them. Consider allowing them to nest. [Solution](https://github.com/BaLiKfromUA/pylox/commit/4728a19b990c8e08f5a9d441b4caa59a825f1325)

## My own design/implementation decisions
